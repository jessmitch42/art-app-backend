# CURA♀ED API + DB

This is the backend for the project <a href="https://github.com/jessmitch42/art-app-frontend">CURA♀ED</a>. The DB is seeded and the data won't change (at this time).

To use locally, fork, clone, run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed`. That's it!

## What is it?
CURA♀ED provides a curated list of female contemporary artists you may or may not know. All information and images are from Artsy and Wikipedia and sources are included in the API response.

## Next Steps
As next steps I'd like to expand the number of artists included in the DB. I'd also like to expand the backend to allow for user authentication and user suggestions/uploads.
