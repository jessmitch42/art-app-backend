# CURA♀ED API + DB

This is the backend for the project <a href="https://github.com/jessmitch42/art-app-frontend">CURA♀ED</a>. The DB is seeded and the data won't change (at this time).

To use locally, make sure you have postgres installed and then: fork and clone this repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed`. That's it!

## Why'd I Make CURA♀ED?
I made CURA♀ED as a personal project while completing Flatiron's fullstack bootcamp. It's intended as a sample project but currently isn't getting much attention since I'm working and focusing on learning other new things.

## What is it?
CURA♀ED provides a curated list of female contemporary artists you may or may not know. All information and images are from Artsy and Wikipedia and sources are included in the API response.

## Next Steps
As next steps I'd like to expand the number of artists included in the DB. I'd also like to expand the backend to allow for user authentication and user suggestions/uploads. 

## Contributing
Please feel welcome to create an issue or open a pull request with any bugs/suggestions. Keep in mind this is a small personal project, though..
