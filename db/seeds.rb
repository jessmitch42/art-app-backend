# Mary Corse
artist = Artist.create(first_name: "Mary", last_name: "Corse", birth_year: 1945, nationality: "American", bio: `Best known for her exploration of radiant and interactive surfaces and her innovative technique of painting, Mary Corse first gained recognition for her involvement in the Light and Space movement in 1960s Southern California, along with James Turrell, Robert Irwin, and Douglas Wheeler. Like many of these artists, Corse rejected Abstract Expressionist practices of using accident and relinquishing intention in the application of pigment, favoring instead the controlled formal geometry of Minimalism. As the viewer moves or surrounding light conditions alter, Corse’s works seem to shift subtly, creating a complex spatial and temporal dynamic. As the artist herself eloquently said, “Where there is space, there is time.”`, sources:"https://www.artsy.net/artist/mary-corse"

Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi, documenta in Kassel, Germany, and at Talwar Gallery, which organised the first solo exhibition of her work outside of India in 2003, and which has represented her estate for over a decade, in New York and in New Delhi. Today, Mohamedi is considered one of the major figures of the art of the twentieth century.

# Carmen Herrera
artist = Artist.create(first_name:"Carmen", last_name:"Herrera", birth_year:1915, nationality:"Cuban", bio:`Carmen Herrera is a Cuban-American abstract, minimalist painter. She was born in Havana and has lived in New York City since the mid-1950s. Herrera's abstract works have brought her international recognition late in life. She turned 100 in May 2015. The key to understanding Carmen Herrera’s style is remembering that, before she left Cuba, she was trained as an architect. This foundation can be seen in her urge to use measurements and tools to create orderly art in a chaotic world. In her own words, Herrera thinks about “the line, the paper, about a lot of tiny things that get bigger and bigger… and then a picture comes up." She is also a self-professed believer in the adage that “less is more”.`, sources:"https://www.artsy.net/artist/carmen-herrera, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Herrera")

# Anne Truitt
artist = Artist.create(first_name:"Anne", last_name:"Truitt", birth_year:1921, death_year:2014, nationality:"American", bio:"Anne Truitt was a major American artist of the mid-20th century. She became a full-time artist in the 1950s and made what is considered her most important work in the early 1960s anticipating in many respects the work of minimalists like Donald Judd. She was unlike the minimalists in some significant ways. The sculptures that made her significant to the development of Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. Fabricated from wood and painted with monochromatic layers of acrylic, they often resemble sleek, rectangular columns or pillars. Truitt produces in scale drawings of her structures that are then produced by a cabinetmaker. The structures are weighed to the ground and are often hollow, allowing the wood to breathe in changing temperatures.", sources:``)
